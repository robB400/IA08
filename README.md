# Painting-App
A simple painting app for android

# Instructions:
I ran this app on an android studio emulator of a Google Pixel 2 XL with API 33
Once the app is running touch the screen to begin drawing.
The color buttons can be used to change the colors (red, green, blue, black)
The size buttons change the size of the brush (small, regular, large XL)
The slider at the bottom adjusts the opacity. It is set at 100% opacity by default. Lowering it will decrease the opacity
The clear button will clear all of your drawings.
